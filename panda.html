                <h3>PANDA</h3>
                <p>Pandas are large bears native to China, known for their distinctive black-and-white
                    fur and bamboo-based diet. They are considered a symbol of conservation efforts and
                    are adored worldwide.</p>
                <p>Pandas primarily eat bamboo, but they are omnivores and can consume small mammals and
                    birds occasionally. They have a unique thumb-like structure, a modified wrist bone,
                    which helps them grip bamboo while eating.</p>
                <p>Pandas are solitary animals and are known for their relaxed and gentle nature. They
                    spend a significant amount of time eating and resting. Despite their large size, they
                    are skilled climbers and swimmers.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                <p>Visit the Panda Pavilion, a tranquil area with lush bamboo where pandas can be seen
                    munching on bamboo shoots and lounging.</p>
