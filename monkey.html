                <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                <p>Monkeys are a diverse group of primates, known for their agility, intelligence, and
                    playful behavior. There are various species of monkeys found in different parts of
                    the world.</p>
                <p>Monkeys are generally social animals, living in groups called troops. They have
                    dexterous hands and feet, allowing them to grasp objects and swing from trees. Many
                    species of monkeys are omnivores, feeding on a variety of fruits, leaves, insects,
                    and small animals.</p>
                <p>These intelligent animals use vocalizations, facial expressions, and body language to
                    communicate with each other. Some species of monkeys are known for their impressive
                    acrobatics and problem-solving abilities.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                <p>Explore the Monkey Trail, an elevated path through the lush forest where monkeys can
                    be observed playing, swinging, and interacting in a naturalistic setting.</p>
