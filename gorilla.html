                <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                <p>Explore the fascinating world of gorillas, the largest living primates, known for their
                    incredible strength, intelligence, and social behavior. Gorillas share about 98% of their
                    DNA with humans, making them our closest relatives in the animal kingdom.</p>
                <p>These majestic creatures inhabit the dense forests of central Africa, living in cohesive
                    family groups led by a dominant silverback. Gorillas are herbivores, mainly consuming
                    leaves, fruits, and vegetation.</p>
                <p>One of the most remarkable aspects of gorillas is their complex social structure. Family
                    units, known as troops, exhibit strong bonds and communication through vocalizations,
                    gestures, and expressions.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                <p>Visit the Gorilla Sanctuary, nestled in the heart of the Primate Pavilion, to observe
                    these incredible creatures in a habitat that mimics their natural environment.</p>
