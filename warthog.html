                <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                <p>Warthogs are medium-sized wild pigs known for their distinctive appearance with warty
                    protrusions on their faces. They are found in various habitats across sub-Saharan
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>Warthogs are herbivores and primarily graze on grasses, roots, and tubers. They use
                    their strong snouts to dig for food and create burrows where they rest and rear
                    their young.</p>
                <p>Despite their tough appearance, warthogs are generally non-aggressive and rely on their
                    keen senses to detect predators. They are social animals and often form groups
                    called sounders.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                <p>Observe the warthogs in their habitat near the Savannah Zone, where they can be seen
                    foraging and interacting with each other.</p>
