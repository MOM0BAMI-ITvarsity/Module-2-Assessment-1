                <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                <p>Discover the beauty of the gemsbok, a majestic antelope species known for its distinctive
                    long horns and striking appearance. Native to the arid regions of Southern Africa,
                    gemsboks are well-adapted to survive in harsh desert environments.</p>
                <p>The gemsbok's elegant appearance is complemented by its impressive horns, which can
                    reach lengths of up to 85 centimeters (33 inches). These horns are not only used for
                    defense but also as a means to establish dominance within their social structure.</p>
                <p>Gemsboks are herbivores, primarily feeding on grasses and plant matter. Their
                    efficient water conservation mechanisms allow them to thrive in environments with
                    limited water sources.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                <p>Visit the Gemsbok Habitat, located in the Desert Oasis section of the zoo, to witness
                    these magnificent creatures as they navigate the arid landscape.</p>
