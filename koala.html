                <h3>KOALA</h3>
                <p>Koalas are marsupials native to Australia, known for their fluffy appearance and love for
                    eucalyptus leaves. Despite their bear-like appearance, koalas are not bears.</p>
                <p>They have a specialized diet consisting mainly of eucalyptus leaves, which provides them
                    with both water and nutrients. Koalas are well adapted to their arboreal lifestyle,
                    with strong limbs and opposable thumbs for climbing trees.</p>
                <p>Koalas are solitary animals, and they spend most of their time sleeping. They are
                    marsupials, carrying their underdeveloped young (joey) in a pouch until it is mature
                    enough to survive outside.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                <p>Visit the Koala Sanctuary, a serene area with eucalyptus trees, where koalas can be
                    seen lounging and munching on their favorite leaves.</p>
