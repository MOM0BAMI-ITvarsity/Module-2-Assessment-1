                <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                <p>Giraffes are the world's tallest mammals, known for their long necks and distinctive spotted
                    coat patterns. They are native to the savannas of Africa and are social animals that
                    often gather in groups.</p>
                <p>The long neck of a giraffe, which can reach up to 18 feet (5.5 meters), allows them to
                    reach leaves high in trees that other animals cannot access. Their tongue is also
                    prehensile, enabling them to grasp and pull leaves from branches.</p>
                <p>Giraffes are herbivores, mainly feeding on leaves, fruits, and flowers. Their unique
                    spotted coat acts as a form of camouflage in the wild, helping them blend into the
                    patterns of light and shadow in their habitat.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                <p>You can spot giraffes in the African Savannah exhibit, enjoying the tall trees and
                    grazing on the abundant vegetation.</p>
