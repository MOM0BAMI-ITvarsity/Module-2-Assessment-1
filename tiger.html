                <h3>TIGER</h3>
                <p>Tigers are powerful and majestic big cats, known for their distinctive orange fur with
                    black stripes. They are the largest cat species and are native to various habitats in
                    Asia.</p>
                <p>As carnivores, tigers are apex predators and primarily hunt ungulates such as deer and
                    wild boar. They are solitary animals, with males and females coming together only
                    during mating season.</p>
                <p>Tigers have powerful limbs and can swim well, enjoying the water. Unfortunately, many
                    tiger species are endangered due to habitat loss and poaching.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                <p>Experience the thrill of seeing tigers in the Tiger Territory, a specially designed
                    habitat that mimics their natural surroundings.</p>
